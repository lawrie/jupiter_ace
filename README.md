# Jupiter Ace for the Ulx3s and Ulx4m Ecp5 FPGA boards

## Introduction

The Jupiter Ace was a British home computer from 1982, which ran [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) rather than Basic.

For help using it, download the [User Manual](https://www.jupiter-ace.co.uk/downloads/JA-Manual-Second-Edition-[Updated-12-2011].zip).

If you type `vlist`, the Forth vocabulary list will be shown:

This implementation currently has the 16kb ram extension, but no cassette loading or saving.

It uses a PS/2 keyboard connected to the us2 port on the Ulx3s, and assumes UK layout.

Output is HDMI.
